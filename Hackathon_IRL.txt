 Project is a Hackathon management game

 Top down realtime 2D PC game, written in Unity(?)

 Player controls a 'host' who must manage the needs of a Hackathon where
 there are tables at which coders sit and produce code. The coders needs must
 be met for the game to progress. Their needs will generally take the form
 of pizza, red bull, cigarettes(?)

 Player must take the items needed to the coders as their needs indicate. If their
 needs are not met before the timer runs out, the hackers at that table leave, costing
 the player a 'life'. If the player loses three lives, the game ends.
